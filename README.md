# Popular-Movies

App used to browse recent popular and top-rated movies. This was originally part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program (Project 1 - 2). I have since taken my initial submission and attempted to update it following best practices (MVP architecutre, TDD (presesnter layer), multiple build types and dependency injection).
